# PocketForge: The Autonomous Oracle-Architect Mobile IDE

**PocketForge** is the world's first full-stack, cross-platform mobile coding environment, engineered to outperform all competitors by 2026. Built with a Rust backend and a Kotlin Multiplatform frontend, it delivers a production-ready, VS Code-like experience with integrated AI, Docker-in-Docker support, and seamless cloud integration.

## 🚀 Features at a Glance

*   **Cross-Platform:** Single codebase for iOS, iPadOS, Android, and macOS (Catalyst) via Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform.
*   **True Terminal:** Real PTY with full Docker-in-Docker support, enabling execution of `docker run`, `kubectl`, and `ollama run` inside isolated Firecracker microVMs.
*   **Autonomous AI Agent:** Integrated Multi-Tool-Calling (MTC) agent (powered by Claude/Grok/Gemini) that can autonomously read/write files, run shell commands, and debug code.
*   **Integrated Marketplace:** Supports the native **VXIX** extension format and includes a server-side translation layer for compatibility with standard **VSIX** (VS Code) extensions.
*   **MCP Integration:** Securely proxies all available Model Context Protocol (MCP) services (Hugging Face, Vercel, Notion, etc.) for a fully connected development workflow.
*   **One-Tap Deploy:** Integrated deployment buttons for Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, Railway, and Render.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a clean, decoupled monorepo structure:

| Component | Technology Stack | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Rust (Axum, Tokio) | API Gateway, Authentication (Supabase/GitHub), Container Orchestration (Fly.io), MCP Proxy. |
| **Frontend** | Kotlin Multiplatform (Compose, Voyager) | UI/UX, Terminal Client (Ktor WebSockets), Extension Host. |
| **Runtime** | Fly.io Firecracker MicroVMs | Isolated, ephemeral development environments. |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | User management, container metadata, billing. |

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  **Rust:** Install the Rust toolchain.
2.  **Kotlin/Gradle:** Install a JDK (version 17+) and configure Gradle.
3.  **Fly.io CLI:** Install and authenticate `flyctl`.
4.  **GitHub PAT:** A Personal Access Token with `repo` and `user:email` scopes.

### 1. Backend Setup (Rust/Axum)

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd PocketForge/backend`
2.  Set up environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file):
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="<YOUR_SUPABASE_POSTGRES_URL>"
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_ID>"
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR_GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET>"
    FLY_API_TOKEN="<YOUR_FLY_API_TOKEN>"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>" # For Gemini Integration
    ```
3.  Run the server locally: `cargo run`

### 2. Frontend Setup (Kotlin Multiplatform)

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd PocketForge/frontend`
2.  Run the Android application: `./gradlew :android:run`
3.  Run the Desktop application: `./gradlew :desktop:run`

## 🌐 Web Deployment (WASM)

The Kotlin Multiplatform frontend can be compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for a web application experience. See the **Web Deployment Guide** for detailed steps.

## 🧩 Extension Development (VXIX)

Extensions are packaged as **VXIX** files. They consist of an `extension.json` manifest and a sandboxed `extension.js` file. The `ExtensionHost` provides a secure API for interacting with the IDE.
